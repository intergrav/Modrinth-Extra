    <h1>Modrinth Extra</h1>
    <p>Thank you for installing <strong>Modrinth Extra</strong>! If you haven't already read the page, this
        extension has almost little-to-no features currently. The only current feature is extra animations, like fading
        and sliding.</p>
    <p>However, if you would like to <strong>contribute</strong> and add your own features to the project, feel free to
        make a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/intergrav/Modrinth-Extra">GitHub repository</a>! It would
        be <em>greatly appreciated</em> and would definitely help us grow this project.</p>
    <p>Anyways, go try it out on <a href="https://modrinth.com">Modrinth</a>! Enjoy.
